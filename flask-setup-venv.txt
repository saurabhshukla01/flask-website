how to do setup venv for each project :

Creating a **virtual environment (venv)** for each Flask project is a best practice to isolate dependencies. Here's a step-by-step guide:

---

### ✅ Step-by-Step: Create `venv` for a Flask Project

#### 1. **Navigate to Your Project Folder**

If you don’t have a project folder yet:

```bash
mkdir flask_project
cd flask_project
```

#### 2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

Use Python's built-in `venv` module:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

* `python` refers to your Python executable (you can use `python3` if needed).
* `venv` is the name of the environment folder (you can name it anything like `.venv`, `env`, etc.).

#### 3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

##### On **Windows**:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

##### On **macOS/Linux**:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### 4. **Install Flask**

Now that you're in the virtual environment:

```bash
pip install flask
```

#### 5. **Freeze Dependencies (Optional but Recommended)**

To save your dependencies to a file:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

You can later install from this file in another environment using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 6. **Deactivate When Done**

When you're finished working:

```bash
deactivate
```

### 💡 Best Practices

* Keep each Flask project in its own folder with a dedicated `venv`.
* Always activate the environment before running the app or installing packages.
* Add `venv/` to your `.gitignore` if you're using Git.

Fix powershell issue not runing script direct >>

You're getting this error because **PowerShell's execution policy** doesn't allow running scripts like `Activate.ps1`, which is needed to activate your virtual environment.

---

### ✅ Solution: Change PowerShell Execution Policy

You can fix this by **temporarily or permanently changing the execution policy**.

#### 🟡 Option 1: Temporarily Allow Script Execution (Recommended)

Run PowerShell as Administrator and enter:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
```

* ✅ This only affects the current PowerShell session.
* 🔐 Safer because it doesn’t change system-wide settings.
* Then, run:

  ```powershell
  .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  ```

---

#### 🔵 Option 2: Permanently Change Execution Policy (If You Prefer)

Run PowerShell **as Administrator** and enter:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

* This allows locally created scripts to run (like `activate.ps1`).
* Safer than `Unrestricted`, but still lets you activate venv.

---

### ✅ Alternative: Use CMD Instead of PowerShell

If you prefer not to change PowerShell settings, you can use Command Prompt (CMD):

```cmd
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Or from Git Bash:

```bash
source venv/Scripts/activate
```

---

### 💡 Tip for VS Code Users

To always open your terminal with CMD (if PowerShell is restricted):

1. Go to **File > Preferences > Settings**.
2. Search for **"terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.windows"**.
3. Change it to `"Command Prompt"`.
